/*
 * Purpose:
 *   This program aims to stress the CPU store buffer.
 *
 * Theory:
 *   The program performs a large number of back-to-back writes to
 *   memory in order to saturate the CPU store buffer. The addresses
 *   written to by each store are in different cache lines to prevent
 *   them being merged in the store buffer. The code marks the writes
 *   as volatile to prevent the compiler from optimizing them away.
